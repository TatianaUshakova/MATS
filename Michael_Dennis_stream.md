## Whatâ€™s your motivation for applying to this stream and project? (max 100 words)

I am very interested in reinforcement learning and in learning in general conceptually. I am also very interested in applications of rl and ml to real world problems: I think robotics and other physical agents are things of the huge impact and potential applications. I would be interested in improving the learning protocols/algorithms to get better in solving relevant problems of real world agents, especially in the topic of reward design (for example, in the style of formulation of a problem as in the 'CIRL' article). 

## What do you want to work on? Please give a 3-5 paragraph pitch for your research idea that fits this stream.

While I am not very familiar with that currently happening in the area, here are some of my thoughts from reading the CIRL article. 

.. to be added, sorry, it took more time than I thought it would to carefully formulate the research proposal, hope to finish working on it by end of Sunday..

## Explain your strongest disagreement with other alignment thinkers. Consider only your own inside-view understanding, and don't defer to others' expertise.

I am not as familiar with main stream views of alignment thinkers, though from talking to people in EAG I got the feeling that a lot of people there are focusing in my opinion too much on mechanical interpretability compared to other methods. I dont think it is scalable enough to produce the results when models get bigger. And I think much more applied areas are actually much more promising even when they not involving the true understanding of the models. Also I think there is too big focus on potential problems compared to the problems that already exist or can exist in the closest nearest future. For this reason red-teaming and real world agent safety styles of research directions seem to me much more appealing.  


## What are your chances of being interested in continuing to work together beyond the 2-month MATS program? E.g. Extending for another 2 months until the project runs to completion. Include a %, with some explanation of your number as needed.

80% - Would be very interested to continue working on the project assuming the project goes well and there is a potential for good output/results.
